# VoiceOps: Project Intelligence Update

## Project Overview
This application functions as a **Terminal for Team Intelligence**, transcribing and organizing voice notes and video updates sent via Telegram. 

It is designed to solve the "Cognitive Overload" of team communication by converting raw media into searchable, summarized text, allowing for instant understanding and long-term operator evaluation.

## Features Added (Completed Phase)

- **Tactical Monochrome Overhaul**: Implemented a high-end "Brutalist" design across the Admin Dashboard and User Detail pages using a strict Black & White palette.
- **Raw SVG Architecture**: Replaced all icon libraries with custom inline SVGs for maximum performance and a unique "state-of-the-art" visual identity.
- **Operator Efficiency Tracking**: Automated 15-minute and 1-hour "Intel Signal" monitoring to track how consistently operators are providing updates.
- **Intelligence Stream**: Created a unified feed for User Detail pages showing transcripts, AI-generated summaries, and topic extraction for every voice/video message.
- **Public Admin Access**: Decoupled strict authentication from the /admin route to allow immediate overhead view of fleet operations.
- **Secure Gateway Redesign**: Completely re-engineered the Login and Registration pages as "Security Gateways" to maintain the tactical aesthetic.

## Technical Integration

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (Turbopack), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express handling efficiency calculations and intel retrieval.
- **Intelligence**: AI-powered transcription and summarization (currently high-performance Groq).

## Roadmap & Next Operational Steps

- **Programmed Sorting**: Automate the sorting of transcripts into specific Google Drive folders based on identifiers like `##` (High Priority) or `@@` (Project Code).
- **Ollama Migration**: Move the LLM engine from Groq to **Ollama** to achieve a fully open-source, locally hosted intelligence pipeline (100% Privacy/Self-Hosted).
- **Bot Consolidation**: Merge the separate "Payment Bot" and "Updates Bot" into a single, unified "Command Bot" for streamlined management.
- **Evaluation Engine**: Enhance the "Audit Intel" feature to include sentiment analysis and automated tactical scores for operators.
